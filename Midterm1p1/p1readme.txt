main calls three functions to create three different test cases of linked lists. I do not pass head into the isEven function.
Instead, i create an even, odd, and empty linked list right before the function call. If it is even, it prints out true and the linked list.
If odd, it prints false and prints the linked list. If empty, it prints true and prints an empty line.
