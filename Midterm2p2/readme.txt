In order to run function, you need to give the program an integer with the starting node where BFT occurs from that node.
I got mostOutgoing() to work, but I think it doesnt fully traverse through the graph.

I did not get mostIncoming() to work.

I tried using a vector to store the count of every city whenever an edge was found but that didnt work correctly. Outgoing is easier than Incoming.
